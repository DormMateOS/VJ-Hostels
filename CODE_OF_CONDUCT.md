# Code of Conduct

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for being part of the Hostel Management System community! Whether you're here to report a bug, suggest a feature, contribute code, improve documentation, or simply explore the project, we're glad you're here.

This Code of Conduct is more than just a set of rulesâ€”it's a shared promise to treat each other with respect, empathy, and fairness. We want every participant, whether a newcomer or a long-time contributor, to feel safe, valued, and heard.

Discrimination, harassment, or harmful behavior of any kind have no place here. Together, we can create a space where curiosity is encouraged, creativity flourishes, and collaboration feels natural. Let's make this a community we can all be proud of! ðŸŒŸ

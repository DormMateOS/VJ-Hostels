# How to Sync Students to Rooms

## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains how to synchronize students with their assigned rooms in the Hostel Management System.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- MongoDB is running and connected
- All 469 rooms are already generated in the database:
  - Room 001 (special/extra room)
  - Rooms 101-139 (Floor 1)
  - Rooms 201-239 (Floor 2)
  - ...
  - Rooms 1201-1239 (Floor 12)
- Students are in the database with `roomNumber` field populated

## 🚀 Method 1: Using the Sync Script (Recommended)

### Step 1: Navigate to Server Directory
```bash
cd server
```

### Step 2: Run the Sync Script
```bash
node utils/syncStudentsToRooms.js
```

### What the Script Does:
1. ✅ Connects to MongoDB
2. ✅ Checks if room 001 exists (creates if missing)
3. ✅ Fetches all students from database
4. ✅ Fetches all rooms from database
5. ✅ Clears existing occupants for fresh sync
6. ✅ Matches each student's `roomNumber` with rooms
7. ✅ Adds student IDs to room `occupants` arrays
8. ✅ Respects capacity limit (3 students per room)
9. ✅ Saves all updated rooms
10. ✅ Shows detailed summary

### Expected Output:
```

💡 Next steps:
   1. Check your MongoDB to verify room occupants
   2. Open Admin Portal > Room Management
   3. Click on any room to see occupants
```

## 🌐 Method 2: Using Admin Portal

### Step 1: Login to Admin Portal
Navigate to your admin dashboard

### Step 2: Go to Room Management
Click on "Room Management" in the sidebar

### Step 3: Click Sync Button
Click the **"🔄 Sync Students to Rooms"** button at the top

### Step 4: Confirm
Confirm the sync operation when prompted

### Step 5: View Results
- Check the statistics dashboard
- Browse rooms by floor
- Click any room to see its occupants

## 📊 Understanding the Sync Process

### Data Flow:
```
Student Collection          Room Collection
┌─────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────┐
│ _id: 507f1f...  │        │ roomNumber: "305"│
│ name: "John"    │   ───▶ │ occupants: [     │
│ roomNumber:"305"│        │   507f1f...,     │
│ rollNumber:...  │        │   508a2b...      │
└─────────────────┘        │ ]                │
                           │ capacity: 3      │
                           └──────────────────┘
```

### Matching Logic:
1. For each student, find `student.roomNumber` (e.g., "305")
2. Search for room where `room.roomNumber === "305"`
3. If found and room has space, add `student._id` to `room.occupants`
4. Skip if room is full (3 occupants) or room doesn't exist

## 🔍 Verifying the Sync

### Check MongoDB:
```javascript
// In MongoDB shell or Compass
db.rooms.findOne({ roomNumber: "305" })

// Should show:
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  roomNumber: "305",
  floor: 3,
  capacity: 3,
  occupants: [
    ObjectId("507f1f..."),
    ObjectId("508a2b..."),
    ObjectId("509c3d...")
  ]
}
```

### Check Admin Portal:
1. Navigate to Room Management
2. Click on room 305
3. Should see list of 3 students with details:
   - Name
   - Roll Number
   - Branch
   - Year
   - Contact info

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "No students found in database"
**Cause**: Students collection is empty
**Solution**: 
- Import students from Excel files first
- Files location: `server/seedData/vnrboys-2.xls`, etc.
- Or add students through the admin portal

### Issue 2: "Missing rooms" warning
**Cause**: Student has `roomNumber` that doesn't exist in rooms collection
**Solution**:
- Check student data for typos in room numbers
- Ensure all rooms are generated (run room generation if needed)
- Valid room numbers: 001, 101-139, 201-239, ..., 1201-1239

### Issue 3: "Capacity full" warnings
**Cause**: More than 3 students assigned to same room
**Solution**:
- Review student room assignments
- Reassign students to available rooms
- Use "Change Room" feature in admin portal

### Issue 4: Room 001 not found
**Cause**: Room 001 wasn't created
**Solution**: The script automatically creates it, or run:
```javascript
db.rooms.insertOne({
  roomNumber: "001",
  floor: 0,
  capacity: 3,
  occupants: []
})
```

## 🔄 Re-running the Sync

The sync is **idempotent** - you can run it multiple times safely:
- Clears all occupants first
- Re-syncs from scratch
- No duplicates will be created

When to re-run:
- After bulk student imports
- After changing student room assignments
- After fixing data issues
- To refresh occupancy data

## 📝 Script Location

The sync script is located at:
```
server/utils/syncStudentsToRooms.js
```

## 🔐 API Endpoint

The admin portal uses this endpoint:
```
POST /admin-api/rooms/sync
Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```

## 📈 Performance

- **Speed**: ~1-5 seconds for 500 students
- **Memory**: Minimal, efficient bulk operations
- **Database**: Uses efficient queries and batch saves
- **Safe**: Clears and re-syncs to avoid inconsistencies

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After successful sync:
- ✅ Each room's `occupants` array contains student IDs
- ✅ No room exceeds 3 occupants
- ✅ Room 001 is handled correctly
- ✅ Admin can view occupants when clicking a room
- ✅ Statistics show accurate occupancy rates

## 💡 Tips

1. **Backup First**: Consider backing up your database before major syncs
2. **Check Data**: Verify student `roomNumber` fields are correct
3. **Run Off-Peak**: For large datasets, run during low-traffic times
4. **Monitor Logs**: Watch console output for warnings
5. **Verify Results**: Always check a few rooms manually after sync

## 🆘 Need Help?

If sync fails:
1. Check MongoDB connection
2. Verify student data has `roomNumber` field
3. Ensure rooms collection exists
4. Check server logs for detailed errors
5. Verify room numbers match exactly (string comparison)
